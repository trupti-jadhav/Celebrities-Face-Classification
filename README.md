# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project involves working on two different datasets using some of advanced machine learning alogorithms.
The first part is using handwritten digit dataset and covering the following things:
1) implementing forward  pass algorithm
2) implementing backward propagation algorithm
3) hyper parameter tuning
4) comparing the performance of deep neuralnetwork with normal neural networks on Celebrity faces dataset
5) comparing the performance of convoltional neural network with normal neural network on handwritten digit dataset

The second part is using handwritten digit dataset and covering the following things:
1) Logistic Regression as Binary classifier
2) Multiclass Logistic Classifier
3) Support Vector machine with linear and radial kernel
